# Melanoma-Detection-Assignment
## Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

### About the Datset
**The data set contains the following diseases:**

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

## Project Pipeline

1. Data Reading/Data Understanding → Defining the path for train and test images 
2. Dataset Creation→ Create train & validation dataset from the train directory with a batch size of 32. Also, make sure you resize your images to 180*180.
3. Dataset visualisation → Create a code to visualize one instance of all the nine classes present in the dataset 
4. Model Building & training : 
   - Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model, rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
   - Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
   - Train the model for ~20 epochs
   - Write your findings after the model fit. You must check if there is any evidence of model overfit or underfit.
   - Chose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting 

5. Model Building & training on the augmented data :
   - Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
   - Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
   - Train the model for ~20 epochs
   - Write your findings after the model fit, see if the earlier issue is resolved or not?
   
6. Class distribution: Examine the current class distribution in the training dataset 
    - Which class has the least number of samples?
    - Which classes dominate the data in terms of the proportionate number of samples?
    - Handling class imbalances: Rectify class imbalances present in the training dataset with Augmentor library.
    - Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data :
      - Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model, rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
      - Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
      - Train the model for ~30 epochs
      - Write your findings after the model fit, see if the issues are resolved or not?
